I am Daniel Semakula, currently studying Level 3 Games Design and Development at New Collage Nottingham.
<br /> 
The content of this website will include peices of work I have created in my time on my course.
<br />
I have also a blog that I use to document changes that I have had throughout the different tasks and assignments.
